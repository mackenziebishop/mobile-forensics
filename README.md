# Using VMWare to get the android Emulator!
There's websites out there that allows you to download the Virtual Machine for Android. I tried to do it and I failed miserably. 
But when you're going through the steps that you find either you 
On this website https://www.howtogeek.com/164570/HOW-TO-INSTALL-ANDROID-IN-VIRTUALBOX/
Or you can go to this website https://itechbrand.com/how-to-install-android-in-virtualbox/
If you go to the howtogeek website, you'll find how to install the proper .iso file for the Virtual Machine
I'd prefer the itechbrand website because it shows you step by step with pictures
The virtual machine setup should look like this:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69910906/141039454-93a3a7fd-90f4-428c-ab04-fa74d211f56f.png)

Once all the steps are solved, you'll have your android Emulator and the display should look like this:

# How is it Beneficial with Digital Forensics?
We're in a world where cell phones hold a TON of information benefiting the digital forensics field.
Decrypting and Extracting data is a few of the key points in helping find valuable information
With Andriller, you can gain access to call logs, messages, emails, and social media activity.
It'll access a lot of the databases inside of the device allowing you to piick and choose which data you would like to extract.

Then once it searches and finds all of the data inside the database of the device, it will print it out in a beautiful format like so.
